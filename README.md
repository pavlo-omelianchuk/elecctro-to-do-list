The application allow the user to;

- List the items on the to-do list, optionally filtered by state and sorted.
- Add an item to the list.
- Edit an item on the list (i.e., change its description or mark it as complete).
- Remove an item from the list.

## Conected to LocalStorage

Have the application synchronize its global state with the browser’s local storage, to allow the user
to close and re-open the browser without losing information.
